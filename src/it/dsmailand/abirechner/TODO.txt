Priorities:
The two last labels in the OutputPanel should actually display something
See if Subject.foreignLang is needed 
    ^ definitely needed by Optimizer, not working atm
Debug Optimizer
Check written/oral exam distinction in readInputToData();
Filter A-Level subjects in ChoicePanel according to eligibility
Abort the calculation if the input is not correct
Fix ChoicePanel interaction with Data (saving/loading)

Secondary:
Add a tooltip to the OutputPanel.scoreLabel to show the composition of the score (GK, LK, ABI)
Apply the highlighting system to the choicePanel as well
Update the options in the ChoicePanel when the user changes optional subjects
Do something with the exceptions thrown in Data (mark below 1,0?)
Populate the ChoicePanel according to chosen subjects
Jump to the next TextField when a valid number is entered
Think about the choice of colors in SubjectUI.setMarkInputFieldHighlight
Output saved choices to outputPanel


If we got nothing better to do:
Add EULA, disclaimers
Easter eggs?
