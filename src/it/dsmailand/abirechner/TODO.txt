Priorities:
The alreadyUsed indicators in SubjectUI must be reset if the user returns to editing content
The labels in the OutputPanel should actually display something
Actually highlight input based on usedState
integrate choicePanel
See if Subject.foreignLang is needed 
    ^ definitely needed by Optimizer, not working atm
Debug Optimizer

Secondary:
Do something with the exceptions thrown in Data (mark below 1,0?)
Add file type filter in Listeners.fc
Populate the ChoicePanel according to chosen subjects
Decide how to use foreground/background colors for highlighting input


If we got nothing better to do:
Add EULA, disclaimers
Easter eggs?
