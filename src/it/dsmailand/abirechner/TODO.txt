Priorities:
The two last labels in the OutputPanel should actually display something
Actually highlight input based on usedState
integrate choicePanel
See if Subject.foreignLang is needed 
    ^ definitely needed by Optimizer, not working atm
Debug Optimizer

Secondary:
Do something with the exceptions thrown in Data (mark below 1,0?)
Populate the ChoicePanel according to chosen subjects
Decide how to use foreground/background colors for highlighting input
Jump to the next TextField when a valid number is entered


If we got nothing better to do:
Add EULA, disclaimers
Easter eggs?
