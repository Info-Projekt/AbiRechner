Priorities:
Debug Optimizer
Filter A-Level subjects in ChoicePanel according to eligibility

Secondary:
Enable live updating
Allow a maximum of 2 chars in the JTextFields
Add a tooltip to the OutputPanel.scoreLabel to show the composition of the score (GK, LK, ABI)
Apply the highlighting system to the choicePanel as well
Jump to the next TextField when a valid number is entered
Think about the choice of colors in SubjectUI.setMarkInputFieldHighlight


If we got nothing better to do:
Add EULA, disclaimers
Easter eggs?
